# No_SQL_project

We are doing a Sales mannagment project using php and MongoDB for our NoSql course project.

Note : If you want to use our project than delete the mongo folder after downloading it because this is for the local server to use the mongodb library. If you want to connect your php to mongo db than first download composer and mongodb_php dll file. Later, install mongo libraries to the cloned folder.
