# No_SQL_project

(Not Completed)

We are doing a Sales mannagment project using php and MongoDB for our NoSql course project.

Note : If you want to use our project then you have to delete mongo folder and install it again using composer and mongo_php dll. Later, you have to extend to your php files.
