# No_SQL_project

(Not Completed)

We are doing a Sales mannagment project using php and MongoDB for our NoSql course project.

Note : If you want to use our project than create a mongo folder after downloading because that is for the local server to use the mongodb library. You can do this using composer and mongodb_php dll file. Download them and install. Later, install mongodb libraries to the cloned folder using composer.
